A lightweight C++ program that solves linear programming problems using the Simplex algorithm. The program reads a standard form LP problem from user input, constructs a tableau, and iteratively finds the optimal solution.

Why Use This?
✔ Great for learning how the Simplex method works
✔ Useful for small-scale linear programming problems
✔ Pure C++ implementation with no external dependencies
